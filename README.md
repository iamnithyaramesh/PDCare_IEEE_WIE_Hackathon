# Intel - PDCare Application

## Problem Statement

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, leading to significant physical and emotional challenges for patients and their families. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing the disease and improving the quality of life for those affected. However, current diagnostic methods are often invasive, expensive, and inaccessible to many individuals.

The PDCare application aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced voice analysis techniques to detect Parkinson's Disease from voice recordings. By analyzing subtle changes in speech patterns, PDCare provides a non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible method for early detection of PD. Additionally, the application offers a support system for patients by connecting them with community resources and specialists in their area, ensuring they receive the necessary care and guidance throughout their journey.

PDCare is designed to empower individuals with Parkinson's Disease and their caregivers by providing them with the tools and support they need to manage the condition effectively and improve their overall well-being.
